        Pay what you can (PWYC) is a business model where prices are not fixed; instead, customers are encouraged to pay an amount they believe reflects the value of the product or service. 
        PWYC operates on principles similar to gift economies and cross-subsidization, relying on reciprocity and trust to thrive.
