        <h1>Who am I?</h1>
        <p>
        I work full-time in digital advertising technology while also studying to become a full stack web developer,
        honing my skills in HTML/CSS, Python, JavaScript, React, PostgreSQL & MongoDB. Did you know - I made this website from scratch!
        I love converting my ideas into useful/interesting internet web products, just like this one!
        <p></p>
        Additionally, I am an indie author in the making, having published my first childrenâ€™s picture book, 
        <a href="https://chesterthedino.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chester, the Dino</a> in 2024.
        <p></p>
        Besides the above, I enjoy drawing, tourism vlogging, writing, cooking away at <a href="https://unrecipes.net" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Unrecipes.net</a>, and staying fit.

        <h1>Why did you start Okra Travels?</h1>
        <p>
        For both work and leisure, I have traveled extensively to most of India's major cities over the past few decades. 
        During this time, I've assisted my family and colleagues with their travel plans, and their delight and positive feedback have been incredibly rewarding. 
        For two large Australian organizations, I developed a comprehensive travel plan for their teams traveling to India. 
        This included creating an itinerary, booking flights, arranging hotels, organizing airport transfers, handling visa applications, and providing a pre-departure briefing. 
        They didn't have to worry about anything except arriving at the airports and paying their bills. They were thoroughly impressed!
        Motivated by these experiences and my passion for sharing my knowledge of traveling in India, I officially began work on Okra Travels on Monday, June 10, 2024, 
        and by Friday, June 14th, I launched the website!
        </p>
        <p></p>

        <h1>How do you run it?</h1>
        <p>
        I run Okra Travels as a solo, home-based side hustle, balancing it around my daily schedule of work, hobbies, family, and fitness. As the sole manager, 
        I'm free from corporate constraints, allowing me to develop my services quickly and creatively, always with your needs in mind. 
        I personally address every issue that arises and read and respond to every email, question, idea, and feedback.
        I hope you find value in my services and knowledge, and enjoy supporting indie makers, side hustlers, and bootstrapped entrepreneurs. 
        Your support inspires me to keep dreaming big and creating unique products. Thank you so much!
        </p>

        <h1>Why the name, "OKRA"?</h1>
        <p>
        Well, apart from being a staple in my favorite curries, Okra (also known as Lady's Finger and Bhindi in Hindi) is a vegetable used 
        extensively across India's diverse cuisines. Its raw form is admittedly slimy and sticky with a rather distinct aroma, but once cooked with the right spices, oils, and 
        other ingredients, it transforms into a truly delicious dish. To me, this transformation mirrors the experience of traveling in India. 
        Just as Okra undergoes a magical change, travel in India can transform the unfamiliar into something wonderfully memorable. Plus, Okra is universal and diverse, 
        just like Indian culture.
        And let's be honest, Okra just sounds great!
