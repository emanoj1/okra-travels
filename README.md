## Replace Favicon
To update the favicon of your React application, you need to replace the default favicon.ico file with your custom favicon file. Here's how you can do it:

1. **Prepare Your Favicon**: Create a custom favicon image that you want to use. It's recommended to use an .ico file for the favicon. Ensure that the favicon image has the appropriate dimensions and format for best display across different browsers and devices.

2. **Replace the Favicon File**:
   - Locate the `public` folder in your React project directory.
   - Replace the default `favicon.ico` file with your custom favicon.ico file. Make sure to use the same file name (`favicon.ico`) for your custom favicon.

3. **Clear Browser Cache**: After replacing the favicon file, it's essential to clear your browser cache to ensure that the updated favicon is displayed correctly when you reload your React application in the browser.

4. **Verify Favicon Display**: After clearing the browser cache, reload your React application in the browser. You should see your custom favicon displayed in the browser tab or window.


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
