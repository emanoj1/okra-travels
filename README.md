# WELCOME TO OKRA TRAVELS!

Okra Travels is a solo home-based initiative to help travelers in planning their trips to India. Basically, a virtual human travel assistant!

Services include:
1. Researching good flights
2. Assist with hotel bookings
3. Help arrange airport transfers
4. Providing general travel advice

### Pricing
You Pay What You Want!  
We are not a tourist or a travel company but more of a "advisory" role.

### How does it work?
1. Visit the website [Okra Travels](https://okratravels.com.au)
2. Submit sufficient details of your upcoming trip
3. We will prepare the best possible info for you to make the bookings yourself.
4. If you like our service, you donate what you like. If you can't, that's OK too!

### Who runs this service?
The service is run by Manoj Kumar (the owner of this GitHub account too!). For work and pleasure, Manoj has travelled extensively to most of the major cities in India for decades! He has also helped his family with their many of their trips also. Seeing their elation with the service, and his keen interest to share the knowledge of others, he started this service "officially" online on Monday, 10 June 2024.
